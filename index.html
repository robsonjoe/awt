		Step 1: Configure IIS
		Apache listens for requests on TCP/IP port 80. You need to uninstall or disable any program that uses that port. If you have a Professional or Server version of Windows, you may already have IIS installed. If you would prefer Apache, either remove IIS as a Windows component or disable its services.
		New web server conflicts. IIS is using Port 80 and can only be occupied by one service at a time. Default WAMP uses port 80 so we need to stop the IIS service. Click on the root of the IIS and click stop to stop all services.
		Remove from startup if you donâ€™t plan on continuing to use it
