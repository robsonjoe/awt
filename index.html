		<h2 id="step1configureiis">Step 1: Configure IIS (if installed)</h2>
		<p>Apache listens for requests on TCP/IP port 80 so you’ll need to uninstall or disable any programs that uses that port. <p>
		<p>If you have any other server software installed, you may already have IIS activated. <p>
		<p>If you want to use Apache, you can either remove IIS as a Windows component or you can disable it either in the gui or in services.</p>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/1.png" alt="Services">
		</div>
		<p>Go into the start menu and type in Services...then scroll down to World Wide Web Publishing and see if it is running <p>
		<p>If it is running you can roght click on it and click 'STOP'. This will disable the running service and allow you to run Apache. </p>	
		
		<h2 id="step2downloadthefiles">Step 2: Download the files</h2>
		<p>We’re going to use the Windows binary from Apache Lounge. </p>	
		
		<p>It’s provided as a manually installable ZIP file from <a href="http://www.apachelounge.com/download/">www.apachelounge.com/download/</a>.</p>
				<div class="img">
			<img src="images/2.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		<p>You should also <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170">download and install the Windows C++ runtime from Microsoft.com</a>. </p>
		<p>You may have this installed already if you've run other servers, but there is no harm installing it again.</p>
			<div class="img">
			<img src="images/3.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		<p>As always, remember to virus scan all downloads.</p>
		<h2 id="step3extractthefiles">Step 3: Extract the Files</h2>
		<p>We’ll install Apache in <code>C:/Apache24</code>, so extract from the ZIP file and copy the embedded <code>C:/Apache24</code> folder to the root of the <code>C:/</code> drive. </p>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/4.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		
		<h2 id="step4configureapache">Step 4: Install Apache as a Web Service</h2>
		<p>We need to open a command prompt in Administrator mode. When there, we can switch to the <code> C:/Apache24/bin</code> folder and run the command below</p>
		
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/7.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		<p>This sets up Apache24 to run in Windows services as we need to restart the process a lot when developing</p>
		
		<p>We can now go into Windows Services and see the Apache24 service is running</p>
				<div class="img">
			<img src="images/8.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		<p>And if we go to our default browser and type localhost/ in the web address window it should return the default Apache index page below</p>
				<div class="img">
			<img src="images/6.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		<h2 id="step5configureapache">Step 5: Configure Apache and Test</h2>
		<p>Apache is configured with the text file <code>c:/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf</code> contained in the Apache folder. Open it with Notepad or any other text editor.</p>
		<p>There are several lines you should change for production environment</p>
		<p>We can see that by default the SRVROOT is set to <code>C:/Apache24</code>...if you installed it elsewhere you would need to change the path here to wherever you installed.
		<p>We also see that the Listen in the file is configured to listen on various ports...it is set up by default for port 80 but we have added 443 as well.</p>
		
				</div>
				<div class="img">
			<img src="images/9.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		
		<p>We also need to go almost to the bottom of the text file and uncomment the httpd-vhosts.conf line.</p>
		
		<p>We are going to create 2 simple sites to test our Apache install. apacheproj1.tbd and apacheproj2.tbd</p>
		
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/10.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		
		<p>We added the following code to the <code>C:/Apache24/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file </p>
		<p>The first line is the port, the next is out IP addrss and then the last one is our server name </p>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/11.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
			</div>
			<p>Next we need to go into the <code>C:/Apache24/htdocs</code> folder and ceate 2 new folders matching your DocumentRoot folder names from above  </p>
						<img src="images/16.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
			<p>In each of these folders you'll create an index.html file and edit it with the code shown below (changing the names of course) </p>
						<img src="images/17.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
			<p>The 2 lines were added at the bottom to the <code> C:/Windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts</code> file to configure the localhost IP address for the 2 new sites.</p>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/12.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
		<p> </p>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/15png.png" alt="Lounge">
			
		<p>Before attempting to hit the websites thru our browser we need to restart our Apache24 in Services  </p>
		<div class="img">
			<img src="images/18.png" alt="Lounge">
		</div>
			<p>We go into out browser and type in the web address and it should hit out index.html file for each new website </p>
		<div class="img">
